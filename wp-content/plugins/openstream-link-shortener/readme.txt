A self-hosted link shortener that turns a dedicated WordPress installation into a link shortener.

== Description ==

Openstream Link Shortener turns a dedicated WordPress installation into a link shortener (like bit.ly).

Features:

* Create short links with auto-generated or custom slugs
* Click tracking
* Admin UI with searchable, sortable link table
* Copy-to-clipboard for short URLs
* Clean uninstall — removes all data when the plugin is deleted

**Important:** This plugin is designed for a dedicated WordPress installation that serves only as a link shortener. It takes over the admin menu and dashboard.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `openstream-link-shortener` directory to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin
3. Ensure pretty permalinks are enabled (Settings → Permalinks)
